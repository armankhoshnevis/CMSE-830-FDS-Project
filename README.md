# README

This repository hosts my project for the CMSE-830 (Foundation of Data Science) courese.

In this project, I aim to provide deep insights into various factors that consistently impact race outcomes. This goal can be graduated to focus on a few specific races. That is, high-level insights obtained from the larger dataset will be studied in one or two specific circuits from recent years.
